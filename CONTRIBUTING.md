### Code of Conduct

ChronoAid is committed to fostering an open and welcoming environment. Please read and adhere to our Code of Conduct in all your interactions with our projects.

### Getting Started

1. Ensure you have a GitHub account.

2. Fork the repository you want to contribute to.

3. Clone your fork locally: "**git clone <https://github.com/your-username/repo-name.git>**"

4. Create a new branch: **git checkout -b "your-branch-name"**

5. Set up the development environment as described in the project's README.

### How to Contribute

1. Find an issue to work on or create a new one.

2. Comment on the issue to let others know you're working on it.

3. Create a new branch from the **main** branch.

4. Make your changes in the new branch.

5. Test your changes thoroughly.

6. Push your changes to your fork.

7. Submit a pull request to the original repository.

### Coding Standards

- Follow the existing code style in the project you're working on.

- Use meaningful variable and function names.

- Write self-documenting code and add comments where necessary.

- Keep functions small and focused on a single task.

- Write unit tests for new functionality.

- Ensure your code is accessible and responsive.

### Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").

- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...").

- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less.

- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line.

Example:

***

### Pull Requests

1. Ensure your code adheres to the project's coding standards.

2. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, if applicable.

3. Increase the version numbers in any example files and the README.md to the new version that this Pull Request would represent.

4. You may merge the Pull Request once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.

### Issue Reporting

- Be clear and descriptive in your issue title.
